## Motivation
While normally I am an *extremely* private person, and do not discuss my *personal sexual preferences* (i.e. what I find attractive, what turns me on, what I find sexually satisfying or erotic), I felt it was necessary to be *brutally* honest (even *graphic*) about the topic of sex/sexuality. After reading this post, it will be virtually impossible to be confused, misled, or unclear about my sexual side.

## 1 Picture == 1,000 Words
While I am *heterosexual*, I think the best way to really *"communicate"* what I find erotic is through images:

In *figure 1* above you can see a **censored** collection of images (actually it's an *image mosaic* but it's not obvious that the underlying image is [this](https://www.instagram.com/msblairewhite/p/C8Fp_D4JGNM/)) that serves as a *sample* of what I find **erotic**. If you would like to see the *uncensored* **NSFW** mosaic click [here](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.imgbash.com/images/136863.html?fromFolderId=41755) or if you want to see the **NSFW** individual images that comprise the mosaic click [here](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.imgbash.com/folders/erotic/).

I picked these images at random from videos that I like. I didn't think hard about it, or second guess it, I was just honest about what I find erotic. So when I say these images capture what I find erotic, it's *unabashedly true*. Understand that I am not overly fond of sharing this part of myself, and that the only reason I am doing this is to be completely transparent. I believe this transparency is necessary for not only someone who may be potentially interested in me personally, but also for my own self-understanding.
