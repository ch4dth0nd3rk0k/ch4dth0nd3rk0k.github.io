## Impetus
In my experience with dating (on/off the internet) I have become aware of a simple problem: expectations. It seems very common for people to have **VERY** different expectations or motivations for dating. In this post, I will **thoroughly** demonstrate what **YOU** can expect from me, and **WHO** should and should not contact me. My goal is to make it so *unambiguous* what you can expect from me, and who should **NOT** contact me, that **ONLY** the right people will feel comfortable and *confident* contacting me. This will save a lot of wasted time and energy on everyone's part. Because after all time is all we have and we must not squander it.

## Disclaimer
I do want *everyone* who reads this to understand that this is not meant to be *disrespectful* in any way. This is not about *judging* or *discriminating against* anyone. To be clear I am **NOT** perfect, nor do I think I am *"better"* than anyone. There are **PLENTY** of people that I do not meet their standards. I am not their match. And that's ok. I know my place, I know what I can realistically afford, and what I don't qualify for. 

So before you feel offended, understand it's what is best for all parties. I have tried to make it as *"impartial"* and *"unemotional"* as I can, but I will admit that there are some things I simply have no tolerance for. I will attempt to keep things as professional as I can. Ultimately I am just trying to be responsible for solving this problem once and for all. Thank you for your understanding.

## Sexuality
My gut instinct tells me this is going to be the most polarizing *"aspect"* of my personality/identity. I believe it will be a deal breaker for many. That is not a problem at all, and I perfectly understand it. In [this article](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.github.io/blog/2024/08/16/sex-masc-chad) I lay bare exactly what I find *erotic*. Needless to say, if this bothers you or makes you feel uncomfortable: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Financial Support / Dependence
This is maybe one of the biggest issues I see: expectations of some kind of financial support. I cannot stress this enough (and I am sure even when I spell it out there will still be people who ignore it): 

    I am not interested in supporting you financially in any way, shape, or form.


**DO NOT CONTACT ME** if this is what you are *hoping*, *dreaming*, or *scheming* for. There are **NO FREE RIDES** with me. You will be taking care of yourself 100%. There is no *"fantasy"* here and I am never going to be your *"prince charming"* to take you away from all your problems. And trust me when I say, you don't want to owe me money **EVER**. Because if by some method you are able to coax some financial resources out of me, I will make sure to extract **10x** as much value out of you (and it will not be pleasant). What I expect is that you can take care of yourself financially. That you are responsible for this aspect of your life. I am interested in [collaboration not exchange](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.github.io/blog/2024/08/14/modern-dating-dystopia) so I expect you to pull your own weight.

## Friendship Before Romance
I have already written extensively on [this topic](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.github.io/blog/2024/08/03/the-nature-of-romance): *friendship* is the foundation of romance. And laying that foundation is going to take a long long time. **DO NOT CONTACT ME** if you are not interested or capable in investing the time and energy into building a friendship (with the possibility of romance in the future) over a long period of time (years). I am in **zero rush** to be involved *romantically*. You should be just as slow and stable in your approach to romance. If what you are looking for is a quick, immediate *"romance"* I am absolutely not the right match for you. This is going to be a long *long* **long** `long` process, talking over months to years, getting to know each other and ideally working together on some mutual goal.

## Responsibility / Maturity
We have already touched on a specific subset of this topic (the *financial support/dependence* issue), but it applies in general to **ALL** of your life: you need to be a highly *responsible person*. If you do not have one or more of the following: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. You are probably not *responsible* or *mature* enough to match with me:

+ serious career (minimum 10 years)
+ fully self-employed / small business owner (minimum 5 years)
+ advanced education degree (minimum 4 years)
+ property owner

I have **A LOT** of responsibilities on my shoulders, and I have invested a decade and more into multiple degrees. Needless to say, I have a lot of experience committing to a serious investment over a significant amount of time. You need to have a comparable experience as well in order to match me.

## Debt / Financial Issues
This is really a continuation of the previous sections on *financial support/dependence* and *responsibility/maturity*: no serious financial issues or debt are acceptable here. If you are not capable of making responsible financial decisions or paying off any debts you owe: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Contact Form Submission
Filling out a contact form does not in itself guarantee I will respond. I have to look over your submission and determine for myself whether it makes sense to initiate further contact. **DO NOT CONTACT ME** if you believe that you are entitled in anyway to any response or *"return"* for submitting a form. You are entitled to **nothing**.

## Single Moms
I am not interested in raising another man's children: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Criminal History
If you've ever served prison time for a serious crime: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. I cannot afford the risk of dealing with someone with a criminal past, it's just too risky for me.

## Abortion
If you have ever had an abortion: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Drugs / Alcohol
If you use *recreational drugs* or have any kind of *substance abuse* issue: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. While I do drink from time to time, I'm not interested in drugs of any kind.

## Smoking
Same rules about `Drugs/Alcohol` apply to smoking: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Sexual Partner Rate
Let's do a little math. What we want to figure out is, on average, how many sexual partners you have in a $10$ year period (i.e the *ten year rate* or $\text{TYR}$). Here is the formula:

$$
\text{TYR} = \frac{\text{bodies}}{\text{age}} \cdot 10
$$

If after evaluating the formula above using your *body count* and *age* and the value you get is greater than 1 (i.e. $\text{TYR} > 1$): **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. We won't match. My $\text{TYR}$ is less than 1 (i.e. $\text{TYR} < 1$). I don't easily have sexual partners, not even because I'm disinterested in sex, but because I have too many other things that I need to do and it's very difficult to get my time and energy. If you are not the same, we will **NOT** match.

## Long-Term Relationships
If you have had sexual relationships (i.e. your body count is greater than zero: $\text{bodies} > 0$) but none of them were serious and committed relationships lasting at least $1$ year or more: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Dominant Women
This might go without saying, but if you have any interest in *dominating* a man in any way: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Divorce 50/50
If you think women deserve half a man's assets in a divorce settlement: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Women's Opression
If you think women are oppressed ca. 2024: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Trans Women
The same rules about *dominant women* apply to *trans women* but with a few additional stipulations. If any of the below list apply to you, **DO NOT CONTACT ME**:
+ ever *penetrated* men anally/orally or interested/fantasized about it
+ have had or want to get *bottom surgery*

I think it goes without saying that, considering my disposition towards *dominant women*, I am not interested in a *"top"* trans woman. I have **ZERO** tolerance for this kind of behavior. If you are a trans woman you should **ONLY** be interested in being penetrated *anally*/*orally*. You should have **ZERO** interest in using your genitalia for any penetrative purpose. You are not a man, and I am not interested in a man. Your place in my life will be as a woman. Know that, and be about that.

My issue with *bottom surgery* is the obvious health implications. I am not going to take on that risk. Trans women that match me will not need to take on such a risky operation.

## Communism
If you think *communism* is a legitimate solution to societal issues: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Anti-Firearms
If you honestly think *disarming* the public is a legitimate solution for any problem: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Hate Speech vs. Freedom of Speech
If you believe that *"speech"* can be a form of violence, or believe that *"free speech"* should have limits: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. 

## Organized Religion
If you follow any of the *"abrahamic"* religions or any other *organized* religion: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. I do not subscribe to *organized* religion and have no tolerance for it.

## Unresolved Trauma / Issues
No one is perfect, and we all have issues that we must learn to deal with (and ultimately resolve). If you cannot, or don't want, to **deal** with your *issues*, or don't even know what your issues are: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. I have spent many years taking *responsibility* for and resolving my own issues. And while there is always more to learn/improve upon, I am able to **deal** with my issues, and live my life. You need to be able to do the same.

## Sex Drive
If you don't think having sex daily (potentially more than once) is normal, you're *"asexual"*, or any other disposition where you can't just enjoy having sex in your relationship: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. Though I may not be *promiscuous* by most standards, I still have a **strong** sex drive. I still have warm blood pumping in my veins, and I am interested in having an extremely *vigorous* and *active* sex life (within a very serious, mature committed relationship). You should be **100%** the same.

## Long Distance
The reality is that I'm interested in countries outside the U.S.A and that means if we match, I'm probably not in your country (at the moment). This means we will be communicating and becoming friends over a **long distance**. If that is an issue for you, if you don't want to invest that kind of time into getting to know me from a *"distance"*: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. You do need to understand that there is a strong probability that we may **NEVER** actually meet. So all the time you invest into getting to know me, may never lead to an *"in-person"* meeting. You need to be very *comfortable* with this reality.

## Communication Methods
Assuming you fill out the contact form and we begin to message, you need to be very comfortable talking on *both* **audio** and **video** call. If you cannot handle that, for whatever reason: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. If the timing is an issue, we can set a day/time to call. I am very willing to work with you **IF** you are sincere about getting to know me and **respecting** my time and energy. You respect my time, and I will respect yours.

But if it feels like I'm *"forcing"* you to call over **audio** or **video** I will immediately cease all contact with you **permanently**. There is no excuse for being *difficult* about this. I cannot afford to invest time into someone who has some *"difficulty"* calling at least through an **audio** call. If it's this difficult to communicate with you, imagine how difficult  **EVERYTHING** will be. I simply do not have the time for this. Be serious 100% **in** or get out.

## Polyamory / Non-Monogamy
I barely have time to deal with *one intimate relationship* let alone multiple. If you are interested in *non-monogamous* relationships, or have ever been in *non-monogamous* relationships: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Marriage
While I am *only* interested in **monogamy**, I do not believe in the *legal institution* of marriage. There is no *objective advantage* for a man to be *legally married*. **DO NOT CONTACT ME** if you want this in any way, shape, or form. No there are no exceptions.

## Children
You know the harsh reality is, though I would love to have children ideally, I doubt that I will be able to. I simply cannot afford to be a parent (both physically and emotionally). If this is something that **really matters** to you: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. Though it is theoretically possible for me to have children in the future, if I had to gamble I would bet on me **not** having children. I can accept that, and you need to be able to accept that too.

## Socialization
I am very comfortable being alone, and I have an extremely small social circle. I don't enjoy *socializing* for the sake of socializing. I don't really derive much value from interacting with most people, and I also have far *too many* other things I want and need to do with my time. **DO NOT CONTACT ME** if you have an *extensive* social life, you're extremely **extroverted**, or just incapable of being alone. You need to be very comfortable living a *solitary* life, with very little *influence* from the outside world.

## Anonymity
I tend to keep my identity private, and hence I have no social media with pictures of myself or my life. The *"censored"* selfie below is the most you're going to get (until we **video** call). If you're expecting to have a lot of pictures of me, other than what I have provided below, and you can't wait to **video** call to verify what I look like: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Social Media
I do have some *social media* but as I mentioned above, I don't post any pictures of myself and I do **not engage** with anyone on *social media*. I only use social media as an occasional *"creative outlet"* or to get some news. If you are **CONSTANTLY** on social media, spending time commenting and engaging in random *"drama"*: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Online Dating
I'm going for *"quality"* not *"quantity"* when it comes to meeting people (be it on/offline). If you're spending **HOURS** talking to random people from the internet **EVERYDAY**: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. In order to match with me, you shouldn't have the time to talk to **SO MANY** people everyday, constantly spending hours daily talking to random people. No one who has that kind of time to waste can **EVER** match me.

## Open Borders / Immigration / Diversity
If you believe that *"open borders"* is reasonable or you are *"pro-immigration"* or *"pro-diversity"*: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**. 

## Racial Reality
If you think that *"race"* has no genetic basis or scientific evidence, and therefore *"we are all one race"*: **DO NOT CONTACT ME**.

## Moral
If you've made it this far, and at least read the majority of the stipulations I laid out you may notice a very common theme: *responsibility*. What I'm looking for is people that are *mature*, *responsible*, and *serious*. People who **REALLY KNOW** who they are and what they want. These are the type of people who match me, as I am [very serious](https://ch4dth0nd3rk0k.github.io/blog/2024/08/07/all-about-chad), responsible, and I know what I want. If you think you match you are more than welcome to contact me, but be warned I will want to see the evidence of whatever you claim. Talk is cheap here, I want to see what **YOU HAVE DONE**.
