    "At this point having absorbed so much media, including media depicting *romance*, I have become keenly aware of a great lack of understanding about *what is romance*. I see quite often **MANY** profiles on various *social media* where the individual in question professes their *desire* for *genuine love*. Usually it sounds something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"I want a real love ...\"\n",
    "+ \"I'm looking for a genuine relationship ...\"\n",
    "+ \"I'm ready for something real ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What I find, is that these individuals **conflate** *fantasy* with *romance* ... which are two different things entirely."

    "## The Role of Fantasy\n",
    "The real purpose of fantasy is to meet our needs via **external** agents (i.e. something or someone). For example the orphaned child fantasizes about the benevolent parent who will come and *\"save them\"* from their dire circumstance. It is meant to *\"comfort\"* us, a type of *\"coping\"* mechanism if you will: the young woman, seeking escape from her circumstance (her uneventful, miserable reality) dreams of the *\"knight in shining armor\"* or *\"prince charming\"* coming to take her away from all her misery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantasy can even help us to connect with ourselves. We fantasize about *WHO* we could be or *WHAT* we might do, because again this is about *trying* to meet our needs (i.e. our need to realize our self, to become who we are meant to be). But fantasy should never extend beyond the inner world, it is not meant to be anything other than a tool for our inner world."

    "## True Romance\n",
    "So then what is Romance? Simply put, it's commitment. I would argue that Romance is the *OPPOSITE* of fantasy. Whereas fantasy is *easy* romance is *hard*, where *fantasy* is about *your needs* romance is about *collaboration* (it's about *giving* not *getting*). Ironically the only role I see that *fantasy* plays in *romance* is again to help us understand what our *ideal match* (be they masculine or feminine) looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "But romance is, in reality, not a fantasy at all. It is about hard work, commitment, sacrifice, and belief. Romance is not about *filling your needs* (like fantasy is), instead it is about *working together* with another person in a committed relationship. No one in this *relationship* is above the other, they are a *TEAM* a single unit a **family**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example here are some *movie lines* that are *actually* romantic:\n",
    "+ \"You make me want to be a better man\", *As Good as It Gets*\n",
    "+ \"I know you wrote the letter. The only way you could beat my crazy was\n",
    "  by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so\n",
    "  long for me to catch up. I just got stuck\", *Silver Linings Playbook*\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these movies, the *masculine love interest* is an obviously *flawed* individual, prone to all manner of quirks, and rude/difficult/stubborn behaviors. But both these individuals, over the course of the movie come to recognize the worth of their *feminine love interest* counterpart. Their relationship, while at first volatile and even antagonistic, slowly becomes more collaborative and *intimate* as both individuals become closer. What makes this process romantic, is not the fantasy of a *\"perfect\"* love interest (someone who requires nothing from you, and has no flaws or imperfections), but rather the **commitment** that results from both parties **giving** to the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is in fact this word **giving** that is so *key* to what is the nature of romance: two parties willing to commit to **give 100%** to each other, to the relationship, to their growing family. THAT is what romance is truly about."

    "## Who Deserves Romance\n",
    "The truth is it's very easy to fantasize, and to even seek out fantasies (which is what most people do when they think about finding a *\"relationship\"*). But it is VERY difficult to find romance, because simply put it's NOT for children. Romance is for very mature, stable, and developed adults. It is not a toy, it is not a game. It is a serious commitment between two people, who have come together for the purpose of building a life as partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only those who have done the hard work to develop themselves to a certain degree of maturity can ever hope to have any real romance. Much personal development, soul searching, life experience, self reliance, and general maturity must be obtained over decades possibly in order to be *worthy* of romance (and yes you must be worthy). That is the price one must pay. After all, if romance is about *giving* then how can one have romance, if they are empty inside? If they have not invested the necessary time into *filling* themselves, taking responsibility for meeting their needs by their own hand?"

    "## Moral\n",
    "Both *fantasy* and *romance* have their part to play in our lives, but we must develop the maturity and wisdom to understand that these are very different and separate things. What is fantasy should REMAIN fantasy, that is what it is meant to be. Romance on the other hand, waits for those who are willing to do the work in the *\"real world\"* (i.e. the physical world that exists outside of our fantasy). Romance is not about an orphan dreaming of a perfect parent who will fulfill all their needs, instead romance is about two adults recognizing that, despite all the difficulties and imperfections they both possess, they believe in each other. They won't quit when things get hard, when the *\"honeymoon\"* is over. They are **all in**, giving 100% to their relationship. They are ready to take that leap of faith, together, hand in hand all the way til the end."
